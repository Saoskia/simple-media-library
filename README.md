# Simple Media Library

**Simple Media Library** is a simple web application that allows you to keep track of things like books, movies, and podcasts. It allows you to give your media a status and a rating, and there's also the option of providing a link to an external site (for example, perhaps you want to link to a movie's page on IMDB, or a book page on GoodReads). All the data is stored in `localStorage`.
